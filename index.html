        <p>After working in Redlands for 2 weeks, I got to spend a week in San Diego helping out at Esri's User
          Conference. I didn't get to do much visiting, but I really enjoyed
          hanging out at the Coronado Island in my free time. In front of the conference center you can take a boat to
          the island and if you're lucky you can catch a nice sunset, a beautiful concert and spectacular views
          of downtown San Diego.</p>

        <p>After one week in San Diego I travelled to Los Angeles to meet my friend Josefin and start our little road
          trip. I had some issues with my credit card so I couldn't rent a car. So I did the next best thing, I took the
          Pacific Surfliner. And it was an amazing experience, I couldn't believe how close we were to the beach. And
          trains in the US are luxury, you have so much space for legs and luggage.</p>
