        <h2>San Diego</h2>
        <p>After working in Redlands for 2 weeks, I got to spend a week in San Diego helping out at Esri's User
          Conference. I didn't get to do much visiting, but I really enjoyed
          hanging out at the Coronado Island in my free time. In front of the conference center you can take a boat to
          the island and if you're lucky you can catch a nice sunset, a beautiful concert and spectacular views
          of downtown San Diego.</p>

        <h2>Train trip from San Diego to Los Angeles</h2>
        <p>After one week in San Diego I travelled to Los Angeles to meet my friend Josefin and start our little road
          trip. I had some issues with my credit card so I couldn't rent a car. So I did the next best thing, I took the
          Pacific Surfliner. And it was an amazing experience, I couldn't believe how close we were to the beach. And
          trains in the US are luxury, you have so much space for legs and luggage.</p>

        <p>While in Los Angeles, we tried our best to do the touristy things tourists do. We were walking the Walk of
          Fame, went fancy on Rodeo Drive, did a little walking up to Griffith Observatory, played beach volleyball at
          Santa Monica beach, rode our bikes to Venice Beach and we even went for a Frank Sinatra tribute
          concert at the Hollywood Bowl (and missed the first part of the concert because we got stuck in traffic and
          couldn't find
          parking hehe).</p>

          not that much to run and the atmosphere is always nice. It started at 7:30, so by 8:00 I was already
          pumped up with adrenaline and ready to start the day.</p>

          recommend hanging out with them if you live in San Francisco and you're learning Spanish :) Later on I rented
